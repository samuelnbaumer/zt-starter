# Zero Trust Architecture Implementation Report

## Summary

This report documents the implentation and analysis of a Zero Trust Architecture system that demonstrates the transition perimeter-based security to continuous verification. The system implements both centralised and decentralised authentication approaches with contextual verification based on identity, device, time, and risk factors.

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

The implemented system consists of three main services:

1. **Identity Provider (IdP)** - Centralised authentication service
2. **Resource API** - Protected resource service with contextual verification
3. **Local Service** - Decentralised authentication demonstration

### Zero Trust Principles Implementation

The system implements the core Zero Trust principle: **"Never trust, always verify"** through:

- **Continuous Verification**: Every request is evaluated based on multiple contextual factors
- **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Risk scores are calculated dynamically based on user, device, time, and behavior
- **Context-Aware Access Control**: Access decisions consider identity, device trust, time of access, and sensitivity of resources

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Identity Provider (IdP)

#### New Claims and Risk Scoring

The IdP has been extended with comprehensive risk assessment:

```python
# Enhanced user database with risk profiles
USERS = {
    "analyst": {"password": "analyst", "role": "analyst", "risk_score": 0.2, "department": "analytics"},
    "contractor": {"password": "contractor", "role": "contractor", "risk_score": 0.6, "department": "external"},
    "admin": {"password": "admin", "role": "admin", "risk_score": 0.1, "department": "it"},
    "manager": {"password": "manager", "role": "manager", "risk_score": 0.3, "department": "management"},
}
```

#### Dynamic Risk Calculation

The system calculates risk scores based on multiple factors:

- **Base Risk**: User's inherent risk profile
- **Device Risk**: Based on device trust level and recognition
- **Time Risk**: Higher risk outside business hours (7:00-19:00)
- **Context Risk**: Additional factors like first-time access

#### Enhanced JWT Claims

JWTs now include comprehensive contextual information:

```json
{
  "sub": "analyst",
  "role": "analyst", 
  "department": "analytics",
  "risk_score": 0.3,
  "device_id": "mac-001",
  "device_type": "laptop",
  "device_trust_level": 0.9,
  "login_time": "2025-10-25T14:34:39.073455+00:00"
}
```

### 2. Contextual Verification Engine

#### Multi-Factor Context Evaluation

The Resource API implements sophisticated contextual verification:

```python
def evaluate_request_context(claims: dict, path: str, method: str) -> Decision:
    # 1. HIGH-RISK USER CHECK
    if risk_score > HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD:
        return "challenge"
    
    # 2. SENSITIVE ENDPOINT ACCESS
    if path in SENSITIVE_PATHS and role not in ADMIN_ROLES:
        return "deny"
    
    # 3. TIME-BASED ACCESS CONTROL
    if current_hour not in BUSINESS_HOURS:
        if role == "contractor":
            return "deny"
        elif risk_score > 0.3:
            return "challenge"
    
    # 4. DEVICE-BASED VERIFICATION
    if device_trust_level < 0.5:
        return "challenge"
```

#### Contextual Factors Implemented

1. **Time-based Access Control**
   - Business hours restriction (07:00-19:00)
   - Stricter controls outside business hours
   - Contractor access denied outside hours

2. **Device-based Verification**
   - Trusted device registry
   - Unknown device handling
   - Device trust level assessment

3. **Sensitivity-based Access**
   - Admin-only endpoints
   - Sensitive data protection
   - Role-based restrictions

4. **Risk-based Challenges**
   - High-risk user verification
   - Dynamic MFA requirements
   - Contextual step-up authentication

### 3. Decentralised Local Authentication

#### Independent Authentication System

The Local Service demonstrates decentralised authentication:

```python
# Local user database (independent from IdP)
LOCAL_USERS = {
    "local": {"password": "local", "role": "local_user", "department": "local_dept", "risk_score": 0.1},
    "admin": {"password": "admin", "role": "local_admin", "department": "local_dept", "risk_score": 0.0},
    "guest": {"password": "guest", "role": "guest", "department": "external", "risk_score": 0.8},
}
```

#### Local Contextual Verification

- Independent risk assessment
- Local device management
- Session-based authentication
- Local policy enforcement

## Architecture Analysis

### Centralised vs Decentralised Approaches

#### Centralised Authentication (IdP + Resource API)

**Advantages:**
- **Consistent Policy Enforcement**: Single source of truth for authentication policies
- **Centralised Risk Management**: Unified risk assessment across all services
- **Audit Trail**: Centralised logging and monitoring
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services without changing authentication logic

**Disadvantages:**
- **Single Point of Failure**: IdP failure affects all services
- **Latency**: Additional network hop for authentication
- **Complexity**: Centralised system can become complex to manage

#### Decentralised Authentication (Local Service)

**Advantages:**
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure
- **Performance**: Local authentication is faster
- **Independence**: Services can operate independently
- **Flexibility**: Each service can have custom authentication logic

**Disadvantages:**
- **Policy Inconsistency**: Different services may have different policies
- **Management Overhead**: Multiple authentication systems to maintain
- **Security Risk**: Inconsistent security implementations


### Security Analysis

#### Risk Assessment Accuracy

The implemented risk scoring system considers:

1. **Identity Risk** (0.0-1.0): Based on user role and history
2. **Device Risk** (0.0-1.0): Based on device trust and recognition
3. **Time Risk** (0.0-0.3): Based on access time patterns
4. **Context Risk** (0.0-0.5): Based on access patterns and behavior

#### Zero Trust Implementation

The system successfully implements Zero Trust principles:

- **Never Trust**: Every request is verified
- **Always Verify**: Continuous contextual evaluation
- **Least Privilege**: Role-based access control
- **Micro-segmentation**: Service-level isolation
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time risk assessment
